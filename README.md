# Getting Started with this React App
The original folder 'components' contains a App.jsx which is not used.
I created a new folder '1' in which App.jsx is run.

### `npm start`

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
